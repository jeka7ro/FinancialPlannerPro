# Push to GitHub from Replit - Step by Step

Since you've connected Replit to your GitHub account, here's how to push your CASHPOT Gaming System:

## Method 1: Using Replit's Git Integration

**Step 1: Create GitHub Repository**
1. Go to https://github.com/jeka7ro
2. Click "New repository" (green button)
3. Repository name: `cashpot-gaming-system`
4. Description: `Comprehensive gaming management system for ONJN reporting and compliance`
5. Leave as Public or set to Private (your choice)
6. **DO NOT** check "Initialize with README" (we have all files ready)
7. Click "Create repository"

**Step 2: In Replit - Look for Git Panel**
1. Look for a "Version Control" or "Git" tab/panel in Replit sidebar
2. OR look for a Git icon (usually looks like a branch symbol)
3. OR check the left sidebar for Git/Source Control

**Step 3: Connect to Your Repository**
1. In the Git panel, look for "Remote" or "Origin" settings
2. Add remote URL: `https://github.com/jeka7ro/cashpot-gaming-system.git`
3. Or look for "Connect to GitHub" option

**Step 4: Stage and Commit Files**
1. In Git panel, you should see all your files listed
2. Click "Stage All" or "+" next to files to stage them
3. Add commit message: "Initial commit: CASHPOT Gaming Management System"
4. Click "Commit"

**Step 5: Push to GitHub**
1. Look for "Push" button in Git panel
2. Click "Push" to upload to GitHub
3. Replit should handle authentication automatically

## Method 2: Using Replit Shell (Alternative)

If Git panel doesn't work, try the shell:

1. **Open Shell** in Replit (bottom panel or Tools menu)
2. **Run these commands one by one:**

```bash
# Check if remote exists
git remote -v

# If no remote, add it
git remote add origin https://github.com/jeka7ro/cashpot-gaming-system.git

# Stage all files
git add .

# Commit with message
git commit -m "Initial commit: CASHPOT Gaming Management System"

# Set branch to main
git branch -M main

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## Method 3: Manual File Transfer

If Git doesn't work at all:

1. **Create the GitHub repository** (Step 1 above)
2. **Download files manually** from Replit:
   - Select files in file explorer
   - Right-click and look for download/export options
3. **Upload to GitHub** using GitHub's web interface:
   - In your new repository, click "uploading an existing file"
   - Drag and drop your project files
