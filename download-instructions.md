# Download CASHPOT Gaming System to Your Computer

## Method 1: Download as ZIP from Replit (Easiest)

**Updated Instructions for Current Replit Interface:**

1. **Look for the hamburger menu** (three horizontal lines ☰) in the top-left corner of Replit
2. **OR look for "Tools" menu** in the top menu bar
3. **OR try right-clicking** on your project name in the file explorer
4. **Look for "Download" or "Export" option**

**Alternative method if above doesn't work:**
1. **Click on your profile/avatar** in top-right corner
2. **Go to "My Repls"**
3. **Find your project** in the list
4. **Click the three dots** next to the project name
5. **Select "Download"**

**If download option is not available:**
- Replit may have changed the interface
- Use Method 2 (Clone from GitHub after push) instead
- Or use Method 3 (Manual file copy)

## Method 2: Clone from GitHub (After Push)

After you push to GitHub using the commands I provided:

```bash
# Navigate to your dev folder
cd downloads\dev

# Clone your repository
git clone https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/cashpot-gaming-system.git

# Enter the project directory
cd cashpot-gaming-system

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env

# Run the project locally
npm run dev
```

## Method 3: Manual File Copy

If you want to copy specific files:

1. **Select all files** in Replit file explorer
2. **Copy each file/folder** manually to your local `downloads\dev\cashpot-gaming-system\` folder
3. **Maintain the same folder structure**

## Project Structure to Maintain

Your `downloads\dev\cashpot-gaming-system\` should contain:

```
cashpot-gaming-system/
├── client/                 # Frontend React app
├── server/                 # Express.js backend
├── shared/                 # Shared TypeScript schemas
├── uploads/                # File upload directory
├── attached_assets/        # Project assets
├── package.json           # Dependencies and scripts
├── README.md              # Project documentation
├── DEPLOYMENT.md          # Deployment guide
├── railway-deployment-guide.md
├── github-push-commands.md
├── .env.example           # Environment template
├── LICENSE                # MIT License
├── Dockerfile             # Docker container config
├── docker-compose.yml     # Multi-service setup
├── .gitignore             # Git exclusions
└── ... (other config files)
```

## After Download

Once you have the project in `downloads\dev\`:

1. **Install dependencies**: `npm install`
2. **Set up environment**: Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
3. **Push to GitHub**: Use commands in `github-push-commands.md`
4. **Deploy to Railway**: Follow `railway-deployment-guide.md`

## File Sizes

- **Total project**: ~50-100MB (with node_modules)
- **Source code only**: ~10-15MB
- **With assets**: ~20-25MB

The easiest method is **Method 1** using Replit's "Download as ZIP" feature. This gives you the complete project ready for GitHub push and Railway deployment.
