# Download CASHPOT Gaming System to Your Computer

## Method 1: Download as ZIP from Replit (Easiest)

1. **In Replit, click the three dots menu** (⋯) next to your project name
2. **Select "Download as ZIP"**
3. **Save the ZIP file** to your `downloads\dev\` folder
4. **Extract the ZIP file** in that location
5. **Open terminal/command prompt** in the extracted folder
6. **Run the GitHub commands** from `github-push-commands.md`

## Method 2: Clone from GitHub (After Push)

After you push to GitHub using the commands I provided:

```bash
# Navigate to your dev folder
cd downloads\dev

# Clone your repository
git clone https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/cashpot-gaming-system.git

# Enter the project directory
cd cashpot-gaming-system

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env

# Run the project locally
npm run dev
```

## Method 3: Manual File Copy

If you want to copy specific files:

1. **Select all files** in Replit file explorer
2. **Copy each file/folder** manually to your local `downloads\dev\cashpot-gaming-system\` folder
3. **Maintain the same folder structure**

## Project Structure to Maintain

Your `downloads\dev\cashpot-gaming-system\` should contain:

```
cashpot-gaming-system/
├── client/                 # Frontend React app
├── server/                 # Express.js backend
├── shared/                 # Shared TypeScript schemas
├── uploads/                # File upload directory
├── attached_assets/        # Project assets
├── package.json           # Dependencies and scripts
├── README.md              # Project documentation

```

## After Download

Once you have the project in `downloads\dev\`:

1. **Install dependencies**: `npm install`
2. **Set up environment**: Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
3. **Push to GitHub**: Use commands in `github-push-commands.md`
4. **Deploy to Railway**: Follow `railway-deployment-guide.md`

## File Sizes

- **Total project**: ~50-100MB (with node_modules)
- **Source code only**: ~10-15MB
- **With assets**: ~20-25MB

The easiest method is **Method 1** using Replit's "Download as ZIP" feature. This gives you the complete project ready for GitHub push and Railway deployment.
